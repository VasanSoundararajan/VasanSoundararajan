# 👋 Hi, I'm @Vasan

### GenAI Expert & Open Source Contributor building the next generation of intelligent systems.

> *"I don't just build applications; I build intelligent experiences. My passion lies at the intersection of Generative AI, robust software architecture, and collaborative open-source development."* 🚀

I am a dedicated AI/ML Engineer specializing in **Generative AI** and a firm believer in the power of open-source collaboration. I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming innovative ideas into practical, scalable solutions.

## 🚀 What I'm Passionate About

#### 🧠 Generative AI Expertise
I go beyond just using models; I build end-to-end solutions. My expertise lies in architecting systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex tasks.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Building smart systems that reason over private data.
- **AI Agents:** Designing autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and solve problems.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Customizing models to excel at specific, domain-oriented tasks.

#### 🌍 Open Source Contribution
I believe code is meant to be shared, improved, and built upon collectively. Contributing to open-source projects is not just about writing code; it's about being part of a global community that drives innovation forward.
- **Active Contributor:** I actively seek out opportunities to contribute to AI/ML libraries and tools.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** I enjoy tackling issues, refining features, and improving documentation for the benefit of all users.

#### ⚙️ Intelligent Automation
I'm fascinated by creating seamless, intelligent workflows. Using tools like **N8N**, I design and implement automation pipelines that save time, reduce errors, and allow humans to focus on more creative tasks.
